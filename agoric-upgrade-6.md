# Agoric Upgrade 6 Testing Instructions

- Reason for upgrade:

Due to an issue fixed in v6.0.0 final, an ante-handler decorator `ante.NewSetUpContextDecorator()` was not included, resulting in cumulative gas caluculation.

Additionally during debugging, it was discovered that MaxGas was not set in consensus, which results in the usage of InfiniteGasMeter which lead to issues.  This parameter will be changed during upgrade by the upgrade handler to 120000000.

# Testing instructions

Prerequisites:
- Be on linux
- have docker installed and running
- have docker-compose installed

### Run:

```sh
baseupgradename=agoric-upgrade-5
toupgradename=agoric-upgrade-6
git checkout tags/$baseupgradename
rm -rf build.linux
make build build-linux
make localnet-start
```

### Ensure nodes are alive
```sh
./ag0.sh status | jq .SyncInfo
chainid=$( ./ag0.sh status | jq -r .NodeInfo.network )
```

### Generate load
```sh
while true; do
  for f in `seq 0 3`; do
    block=""
    if (( f == 3 )); then
      block="-bblock"
    fi
    ./ag0.sh tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards --from=node$f --chain-id="$chainid" --yes $block
  done
  ./ag0.sh status | jq .SyncInfo
done
```

### Query transactions at a specific height:
```sh
./ag0.sh query txs --events=tx.height=30
```

Note: In the bugged version, in a block with multiple tx, the gas_used is cumulative. For example:
```
./ag0.sh query txs --events=tx.height=32 | grep gas_used
  gas_used: "325991"
  gas_used: "410011"
  gas_used: "494031"
  gas_used: "578051"
```
After this update, the gas for the load transactions above should not be cumulatvie, and relatively similar for each transaction.

### Propose software upgrade governance:

```sh
latest_height=$(./ag0.sh status | jq -r .SyncInfo.latest_block_height)
height=$(( $latest_height + $voting_period_s / 4 ))
voting_period_s=240
./ag0.sh tx gov submit-proposal software-upgrade $toupgradename --upgrade-height="$height" \
  --title="Upgrade to ${toupgradename}" --description="Fixes gas calculation" \
  --from=node0 --chain-id="$chainid" -bblock --yes
```

### Add deposit and votes.

```sh
proposal=1
./ag0.sh tx gov deposit $proposal 10000000stake --from=node0 --chain-id="$chainid" -bblock --yes
for f in `seq 0 3`; do
  ./ag0.sh tx gov vote $proposal yes --from=node$f --chain-id="$chainid" --yes
done
```
### Wait until the nodes stop due to upgrade.

```sh
watch ./check-prop-status.sh $proposal ./ag0.sh
```


### build and apply new version

```sh
make localnet-stop
git checkout tags/$toupgradename

#juggle out the build_dir due to go trying to read files owned by root
mv build.linux _build.linux
make build-linux
mv build.linux/ag0 _build.linux/ag0
rm -rf build.linux
mv _build.linux build.linux
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f gaiadnode0
```

### Validate

Run the load transactions from above, and validate that gas is lower and similar for the multiple transactions, and not cumulative.

```
 ./ag0.sh query txs --events=tx.height=157 | grep gas_used
  gas_used: "77552"
  gas_used: "77642"
  gas_used: "77642"
  gas_used: "77642"
```
